# AbhayCloudGamer Control Plane

AbhayCloudGamer is a premium single-page experience built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to showcase futuristic cloud-computing capabilities such as multi-region orchestration, observability, policy stacks, and immersive dashboards.  

## Highlights

- Hero section with live metrics and animated global posture panel.
- Service overview cards, policy stack, and sustainability-centric storyline.
- Interactive dashboard that simulates workload shifts, updates insights, timelines, and a heatmap visual.
- Pricing tiers, testimonial carousel, and responsive contact form with instant acknowledgement states.
- Glow mode toggle for dynamic theming and subtle motion cues.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for semantic layout and accessibility-first structure.
- **CSS3** with gradients, glassmorphism states, responsive grids, and custom controls.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for metric pulsing, simulations, carousel motion, form handling, and theming.

## Getting Started

1. Open the project folder (`cloud computing`) in your editor.
2. Launch a static server (recommended) or simply open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. Interact with the dashboard controls to simulate different regions and loads.
4. Toggle **Glow Mode** to see the alternate visual treatment.

Recommended local preview command (using VS Code Live Server or similar):

```bash
npx serve .
```

## File Structure

```
├── index.html   # Page structure
├── styles.css   # Visual design system
├── script.js    # Interactivity and simulations
└── README.md    # Project documentation
```

## Customization Ideas

- Replace the simulated data with real APIs from AWS/GCP/Azure.
- Hook the contact form to a backend service (e.g., Firebase, Supabase).
- Add authentication states and user-specific dashboards.
- Swap colors/fonts to align with your branding.
